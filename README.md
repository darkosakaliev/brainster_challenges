# Challenge 06 - Git & GitLab

In this challenge I have to push all the challenges I've completed so far, but I've done this the moment we got introduced to GIT and GitLab.

And now for the short description of my workflow, I cloned the main branch and created multiple branches and renamed them to their dedicated names, adding the necessary files needed to showcase the challenges completed and finally pushing the branches by setting up the remote upstream to every branch on every push. :)
